# AdventureworksBikeShop

This project was created to help visualize the data of Adventureworks, a hypothetical bike shop. Instead of having a specific goal in mind, this report was created so that anyone using it could easily enter in the perameters they're looking for, such as year and product type.

This project also served as a learning experience for myself.
